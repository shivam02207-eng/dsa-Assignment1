Problem Understanding
Design and implement a Weather Data Storage System that organizes temperature data indexed by
(year, city).
Requirements:
1) WeatherRecord ADT with (date, city, temperature).
2) 2D array-based storage: rows=years, cols=cities.
3) Row-major and column-major access methods and comparison.
4) Sparse-data handling (sentinel or sparse matrix).
5) Time/space complexity analysis for insert, delete, retrieve.
